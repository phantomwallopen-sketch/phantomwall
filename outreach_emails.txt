Subject: We built the missing AI safety layer — growing fast

Hi [Name],

I just launched PhantomWall — an open-source prompt-injection firewall + telemetry for AI apps and agents.
In 48 hours, we've had [X] GitHub stars, [Y] installs, and [Z] design partners.

We offer a one-line integration to block prompt injection and data exfiltration attacks.

Happy to share the deck, dataset, and live demo.
