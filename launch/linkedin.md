We just shipped **PhantomWall** — an open‑source prompt‑injection firewall + telemetry for AI apps/agents.

• Detects override/exfil/jailbreak attempts  
• Policy engine: allow / sanitize / block  
• CPU‑only, runs anywhere  
• Red‑team harness outputs a CI safety score

Looking for design partners — we’ll integrate it for you in 30 minutes and feature your score. DM to grab a slot.
