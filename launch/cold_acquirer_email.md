Subject: We open‑sourced the missing AI safety layer—growing fast

Hi [Name],

We just shipped **PhantomWall** — a drop‑in prompt‑injection firewall + telemetry for AI apps/agents. In the first 48h we saw [X] stars, [Y] installs, and [Z] design partners. Teams add it in minutes and cut successful injections dramatically.

We're opening a short diligence window next week; happy to share deck, dataset spec, and a live demo. If [Company] wants to own the standard, now’s the moment.
