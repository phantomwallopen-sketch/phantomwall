**[OSS] PhantomWall — Prompt‑Injection Firewall + Telemetry**

We open‑sourced a tiny guard that detects and blocks prompt‑injection attempts (override, exfil, jailbreak). CPU‑only, simple rules + heuristics, and a red‑team harness that gives a CI safety score.

Looking for feedback, attack samples, and design partners. Repo link in comments.
